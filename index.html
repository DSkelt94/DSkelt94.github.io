                <header class="major"><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
                <p>Welcome to my final year portfolio for the Robotic Modelling and Drone Skin Design module. This report outlines the creative and technical development of an animatronic lion helmet from concept to prototype using a suite of industry-standard technologies.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="conception" class="main">
                <header class="major"><h2>Conception Phase</h2></header>
                <p>During the early conceptual phase, Group A focused on identifying an engaging project idea, initially considering a wearable helmet featuring eyes and an animal-inspired aesthetic. The team continued to explore individual ideas and concepts in the initial weeks of the project, ultimately deciding to pursue a 3D-printed animal helmet incorporating mechanical eyelids as the focus of the design.</p>
                <p>Following group discussions, the team agreed to adopt a cartoonish young lion’s head aesthetic for the helmet. A team member was assigned to create preliminary design sketches of this concept, which were then reviewed by the team to facilitate a final decision, as illustrated in the sketches below.</p>
                <div class="image-pair">
                    <img src="assets/Report Images and Files/Lion Head Sketch Image 1.jpg" alt="Lion Sketch 1">
                    <img src="assets/Report Images and Files/Lion Head Sketch Image 2.jpg" alt="Lion Sketch 2">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Initial Lion Head Sketches</em></p>
                <p>Inspiration for the helmet design was drawn from various cartoon lion characters from film and television, notably Simba from the popular film The Lion King. This served as the creative basis for the aesthetic vision of the helmet.</p>
                <p>With the design concept established, the remainder of the conceptual phase focused on the mechanical design of the helmet’s eyes. Research included methods of eyeball and eyelid movement in robotics, incorporating a review of Staffordshire University laboratory equipment.</p>
                <p>One approach examined a Lego-based mechanical animatronic blinking eye system, demonstrated in a YouTube video. This system featured both lateral eye movement using a multi-motor setup and an eyelid mechanism. However, the team concluded that this system’s size would preclude integration into the helmet due to its bulk. Accommodating it would require a significantly larger helmet, increasing both design complexity and the risk of production failure. Additionally, such modifications would likely surpass the £200 project budget.</p>
                <div class="flex">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kd8dHOArikg" title="Joel Schulz Eye Mechanism" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>An alternative eyelid mechanism was identified, which inspired the team’s subsequent development. This design, based on 3D-printed components and servo motor integration with basic parts, was considered more appropriate. It required considerably less space and weight, allowing room for a human head inside the helmet. Although capable of both eyeball and eyelid movement, the team opted to implement only the eyelid mechanism to reduce costs and adhere to the project budget.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>2.1 Technologies</h3>
                <h4>2.1.1 Blender</h4>
                <p>To support the conceptual phase, the software Blender was used to create initial designs for the proposed helmet. This technology enabled rapid 3D visualisation of the artefact without the need for physical materials or construction. Blender’s interface and sculpting tools provided flexibility to shape the model in a way that closely resembled the intended aesthetic. It facilitated significant creative exploration during the conceptual stage and offered the team a realistic perspective on the feasibility of their vision.</p>
                <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <img src="assets/Report Images and Files/Lion_Blend_Image1.png" alt="Lion Blender Model" style="max-width: 900px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <p><em>Figure 3: Blender Lion Head Image</em></p>
                </div>
                <p>However, the software’s complexity soon became apparent. As its use increased, so did the difficulty in achieving precise designs that matched the envisioned lion’s head. This limitation prompted a review of the team’s skill set, resulting in the assignment of a more experienced member to take on the Blender design tasks...</p>
                <h4>2.1.2 3D Scanning</h4>
                <p>The team considered using 3D scanning technology to capture the shape of a team member’s head, which would have assisted in determining helmet sizing and design accuracy. The resulting STL file could have served as a virtual reference for fitting and for preparing 3D print dimensions. However, the team ultimately concluded that, due to the availability of scaling tools within design software, this approach would not be the most efficient use of time. Given that the design is conceptual and not intended for full production, efforts were redirected to higher-priority tasks.</p>
                <p>Although not utilised in this project, 3D scanning can significantly improve accuracy in production, especially for wearable items like helmets. It can support the development of generalised sizing for consumers, though human variation presents a challenge. Nevertheless, it could enable production of size-specific models that accommodate a range of users.</p>
                <p>One potential issue with 3D scanning is the introduction of surface noise, which can necessitate time-consuming clean-up of the scanned artefact. If employed after the early production stage, this could become problematic, where refinement and reprinting require greater precision and effort to achieve effective results.</p>

                <header class="major"><h2>Early Development</h2></header>
                <p>During this phase of development, one team member undertook the task of project planning, producing the relevant Gantt, Flow, and MoSCoW prioritisation charts to support the team’s progress and objectives within the scope of the project. This team member also established Team A’s GitHub Organisation, enabling the assignment of member-specific tasks and ensuring effective tracking and coordination across all phases of the project.</p>

                <p>Given the strict project deadline of 16:59 on 16th May 2025, the MoSCoW prioritisation chart played a critical role in directing the team’s focus towards the most essential tasks. This approach helped maintain a structured workflow and ensured the team remained aligned on key deliverables. The accompanying flow chart further supported this by providing a visual representation of the project’s current stage, helping the team identify and prioritise areas of design and production development.</p>
                <p>Simultaneously, some team members commenced work on enhancing the digital helmet model within Blender, increasing the mesh resolution to achieve greater geometrical smoothness. Although still in its early stages, this refinement marked a significant step towards developing a model that would more accurately reflect the desired aesthetic, paving the way for final design edits.</p>
                <div class="viewer-3d">
                    <script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/DSkelt94/dskelt94.github.io/main/assets/Report%20Images%20and%20Files/Lion.stl"></script>

                <p>With the completion of early digital prototypes using the technologies, the foundational development work positioned the team for success in the subsequent phases of product production.</p>
                <h3>3.1 Technologies</h3>
                <h4>3.1.1 Industrial Robot Articulation</h4>
                <p>The University’s industrial robotic arm was not utilised during the development of Group A’s artefact, as it offered no direct technical benefits relevant to the design or construction of the helmet.</p>
                <p>However, despite not being employed in this project, the capabilities of such robotic arms can be extremely valuable in production-focused contexts. In a fully scaled manufacturing scenario, robotic arms can significantly enhance development efficiency and reduce production costs.</p>
                <p>This technology also serves as a useful reference for understanding the movement and range constraints applicable to articulated exoskeletons or wearable devices. In the case of exoskeletal systems involving jointed motion—such as arms or fingers—robotic arms provide inspiration for the design of safe, durable systems that incorporate joint or rotational movement within defined limits. In this regard, such robotic systems could be viewed as analogous to the control mechanisms of an exoskeleton and would be more relevant in either the early concept validation or later-stage refinement phases of development.</p>
                <p>A key limitation of these systems lies in their complexity and the high level of expertise required for their operation. Their use is typically restricted to large-scale industrial settings due to the extensive training, maintenance, and safety infrastructure necessary to support them. These factors, combined with the high cost of the equipment itself, mean that their applicability is generally confined to high-budget product development environments</p>
                <h4>3.1.2 Fusion 4 CAD</h4>
                <p>Fusion CAD is a 3D modelling environment specifically geared towards producing accurate and dimensionally precise models, particularly for applications in manufacturing and production. Its suite of tools enables rapid yet precise adjustments, which enhances accuracy throughout the production pipeline and helps to minimise errors during machining or 3D printing of parts.</p>
                <p>These tools are particularly beneficial for integrating mechanical components such as motors, hinges, and other moving parts into a system. They support the design of complex geometries and ensure alignment across multiple iterations, aiding in the refinement of a product throughout its development.</p>
                <p>One of Fusion CAD’s key features is its built-in timeline and development history, which allows users to track modifications and easily revert to previous stages. This functionality proved especially valuable during the development and refinement of the eye mechanism for this project’s artefact. The software was employed to design and improve the eye and eyelid system, contributing significantly to the overall quality and functionality of the final prototype.</p>
                <p>While Fusion CAD is less suited to modelling organic shapes, its strength lies in mechanical detailing, making it ideal for designing the engineered components of the eyelid mechanism. These elements were intended for integration within the interior of the helmet. The inclusion of motion simulation and part rendering tools also enabled validation of the mechanism’s practicality prior to 3D printing, thereby reducing development overheads and helping to ensure the project remained within budget.</p>
                <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <img src="assets/Report Images and Files/Eye Mechanism Fusion Screenshot.png" alt="Fusion Eye Mechanism Screenshot" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <p><em>Figure 7: Fushion CAD Eyelid Mechanism</em></p>
                </div>
                <p>Overall, Fusion CAD served as a strong complement to Blender. While Blender facilitated the initial stages of visual ideation, Fusion CAD contributed critical technical feasibility. Its precision and functional capabilities made it an essential tool for developing key mechanical features of the artefact.</p>
                <h4>3.1.3 Haptic Pen</h4>
                <p>Although not ultimately used in the final development process, the haptic pen presented a promising tool for achieving fine-grain control, particularly suited to sculpting organic shapes such as the lion-shaped helmet...</p>
