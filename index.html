                <header class="major"><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
                <p>This portfolio presents the design and development journey of a conceptual robotic artefact for Assignment 1 – Project Artefact Design and Development within the Robotic Modelling and Drone Skin Design module. This work explores a structured product development process combining both physical and virtual prototyping, culminating in a unique, 3D-printed lion-inspired helmet with integrated mechanical eyelid mechanisms.</p>
                <p>The assignment’s primary objective is to showcase a reflective narrative detailing how prototyping technologies and methods, explored throughout the module, were critically evaluated and integrated to transform conceptual ideas into an artefact. The resulting prototype not only reflects the creative intent of Group A but also demonstrates the practical application of tools such as Blender, Fusion CAD, and 3D printing technology, alongside research and development strategies.</p>
                <p>Inspired by animated lion characters such as Simba from The Lion King, the helmet merges a cartoon aesthetic with mechanical functionality, serving as an engaging case study in wearable robotic modelling. Throughout the phases of conception, development, and production, the project emphasizes design decisions made in response to both creative ambition and practical constraints, including budget, technological limitations, and team expertise.</p>
                <p>This document offers an overview of the prototyping journey, presenting digital models, sketches, technical schematics, and embedded multimedia content such as working files and videos. Some research has also explored frameworks for product design and development that consider environmental impact and client sustainability priorities, helping to inform the broader context of design decisions made in this project (Chatty et al., 2022).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="conception" class="main">
                <header class="major"><h2>Conception Phase</h2></header>
                <p>During the early conceptual phase, Group A focused on identifying an engaging project idea, initially considering a wearable helmet featuring eyes and an animal-inspired aesthetic. The team continued to explore individual ideas and concepts in the initial weeks of the project, ultimately deciding to pursue a 3D-printed animal helmet incorporating mechanical eyelids as the focus of the design.</p>
                <p>Following group discussions, the team agreed to adopt a cartoonish young lion’s head aesthetic for the helmet. A team member was assigned to create preliminary design sketches of this concept, which were then reviewed by the team to facilitate a final decision, as illustrated in the sketches below.</p>
                <div class="image-pair">
                    <img src="assets/Report Images and Files/Lion Head Sketch Image 1.jpg" alt="Lion Sketch 1">

                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Initial Lion Head Sketches</em></p>
                <p>Inspiration for the helmet design was drawn from various cartoon lion characters from film and television, notably Simba from the popular film The Lion King. This served as the creative basis for the aesthetic vision of the helmet.</p>
                <p>With the design concept established, the remainder of the conceptual phase focused on the mechanical design of the helmet’s eyes. Research included methods of eyeball and eyelid movement in robotics, incorporating a review of Staffordshire University laboratory equipment.</p>
                <p>One approach examined a Lego-based mechanical animatronic blinking eye system, demonstrated in a YouTube video (Joel Schulz, 2016). This system featured both lateral eye movement using a multi-motor setup and an eyelid mechanism. However, the team concluded that this system’s size would preclude integration into the helmet due to its bulk. Accommodating it would require a significantly larger helmet, increasing both design complexity and the risk of production failure. Additionally, such modifications would likely surpass the £200 project budget.</p>

                <p><em>Figure 3: Lego prototype mechanical animatronic blinking puppet eyes YouTube Video</em></p>
                <p>An alternative eyelid mechanism was identified, which inspired the team’s subsequent development. This design, based on 3D-printed components and servo motor integration with basic parts, was considered more appropriate (Aqua Cat, 2024). It required considerably less space and weight, allowing room for a human head inside the helmet. Although capable of both eyeball and eyelid movement, the team opted to implement only the eyelid mechanism to reduce costs and adhere to the project budget.</p>

                <h3>2.1 Technologies</h3>
                <h4>2.1.1 Blender</h4>
                <p>To support the conceptual phase, the software Blender was used to create initial designs for the proposed helmet. This technology enabled rapid 3D visualisation of the artefact without the need for physical materials or construction. Blender is frequently employed in robotics design as a simulation tool for testing robotic movement and learning capabilities (Feldotto et al., 2022). Its intuitive interface and sculpting tools offered the flexibility needed to shape the model in a way that closely reflected the intended aesthetic. This facilitated considerable creative exploration during the conceptual stage and gave the team a realistic perspective on the feasibility of their vision.</p>
                <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <img src="assets/Report Images and Files/Lion_Blend_Image1.png" alt="Lion Blender Model" style="max-width: 900px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <p><em>Figure 5: Blender Lion Head Image</em></p>
                </div>
                <p>However, the software’s complexity soon became apparent. As its use increased, so did the difficulty in achieving precise designs that matched the envisioned lion’s head. This limitation prompted a review of the team’s skill set, resulting in the assignment of a more experienced member to take on the Blender design tasks.</p>
                <h4>2.1.2 3D Scanning</h4>
                <p>The team considered using 3D scanning technology to capture the shape of a team member’s head, which would have assisted in determining helmet sizing and design accuracy. The resulting STL file could have served as a virtual reference for fitting and for preparing 3D print dimensions. In industry, 3D scanning is frequently employed to enhance product design and improve manufacturing accuracy and tolerances (Muminović et al., 2024). However, the team ultimately concluded that, due to the availability of scaling tools within design software, this approach would not be the most efficient use of time. Given that the design is conceptual and not intended for full production, efforts were redirected to higher-priority tasks.</p>
                <p>Although not utilised in this project, 3D scanning can significantly improve accuracy in production, especially for wearable items like helmets. It can support the development of generalised sizing for consumers, though human variation presents a challenge. Nevertheless, it could enable production of size-specific models that accommodate a range of users.</p>
                <p>One potential issue with 3D scanning is the introduction of surface noise, which can necessitate time-consuming clean-up of the scanned artefact. If employed after the early production stage, this could become problematic, where refinement and reprinting require greater precision and effort to achieve effective results.</p>

                <p>During this phase of development, one team member undertook the task of project planning, producing the relevant Gantt, Flow, and MoSCoW prioritisation charts to support the team’s progress and objectives within the scope of the project. This team member also established Team A’s GitHub Organisation, enabling the assignment of member-specific tasks and ensuring effective tracking and coordination across all phases of the project.</p>

                <p>Given the strict project deadline of 16:59 on 16th May 2025, the MoSCoW prioritisation chart played a critical role in directing the team’s focus towards the most essential tasks. This approach helped maintain a structured workflow and ensured the team remained aligned on key deliverables. The accompanying flow chart further supported this by providing a visual representation of the project’s current stage, helping the team identify and prioritise areas of design and production development.</p>
                <p>Simultaneously, some team members commenced work on enhancing the digital helmet model within Blender, increasing the mesh resolution to achieve greater geometrical smoothness. Although still in its early stages, this refinement marked a significant step towards developing a model that would more accurately reflect the desired aesthetic, paving the way for final design edits.</p>

                <p>With the completion of early digital prototypes using the technologies, the foundational development work positioned the team for success in the subsequent phases of product production.</p>
                <h3>3.1 Technologies</h3>
                <h4>3.1.1 Industrial Robot Articulation</h4>
                <p>The University’s industrial robotic arm was not utilised during the development of Group A’s artefact, as it offered no direct technical benefits relevant to the design or construction of the helmet.</p>
                <p>However, despite not being employed in this project, the capabilities of such robotic arms can be extremely valuable in production-focused contexts. In a fully scaled manufacturing scenario, robotic arms can significantly enhance development efficiency and reduce production costs (Aldarrat & Drosten, 2023).</p>
                <p>This technology also serves as a useful reference for understanding the movement and range constraints applicable to articulated exoskeletons or wearable devices. In the case of exoskeletal systems involving jointed motion, such as arms or fingers, robotic arms provide inspiration for the design of safe, durable systems that incorporate joint or rotational movement within defined limits. In this regard, such robotic systems could be viewed as analogous to the control mechanisms of an exoskeleton and would be more relevant in either the early concept validation or later-stage refinement phases of development.</p>
                <p>A key limitation of these systems lies in their complexity and the high level of expertise required for their operation. Their use is typically restricted to large-scale industrial settings due to the extensive training, maintenance, and safety infrastructure necessary to support them. These factors, combined with the high cost of the equipment itself, mean that their applicability is generally confined to high-budget product development environments</p>
                <h4>3.1.2 Fusion CAD</h4>
                <p>Fusion CAD is a 3D modelling environment designed for creating accurate and dimensionally precise models, making it ideal for manufacturing and production work. Its tools allow for quick but controlled adjustments, helping to reduce errors during machining or 3D printing.</p>
                <p>For this project, Fusion CAD was used to design and refine the eye and eyelid mechanism. Its timeline and version tracking features proved particularly useful, allowing the team to revisit earlier designs and make detailed improvements where needed</p>
                <p>While it is not well-suited for organic forms like the helmet itself, Fusion CAD was ideal for the mechanical parts. Tools like motion simulation and part alignment helped validate the design before printing, saving both time and material. These features helped ensure the project stayed within budget and technical requirements.</p>
                <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <img src="assets/Report Images and Files/Eye Mech Combined.png" alt="Fusion Eye Mechanism Built in Fusion" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <p><em>Figure 9: Fusion CAD Eyelid Mechanism</em></p>
                </div>
                <h4>3.1.3 Haptic Pen</h4>
                <p>Although not ultimately used in the final development process, the haptic pen presented a promising tool for achieving fine-grain control, particularly suited to sculpting organic shapes such as the lion-shaped helmet. Its key advantage lies in its ability to incorporate human sensitivity into the modelling process, allowing for smoother and more intuitive shaping than conventional tools like a mouse or tablet. The haptic feedback provides a heightened sense of spatial awareness and tactile engagement with the model, which can enable precise adjustments that might otherwise be difficult to achieve (Kim & Hyun, 2023).</p>
                <p>Group A initially considered using the haptic pen during the latter stages of early development to refine the helmet’s aesthetic. However, the team ultimately decided against this approach, as most of the helmet’s visual and aesthetic detailing was planned to be applied post-printing, through manual additions and embellishments.</p>
                <p>While the technology is undoubtedly powerful, it also demands a high degree of dexterity and artistic skill. This requirement posed a challenge for some team members, as the precision adjustments necessary for organic sculpting with the pen required a level of artistic proficiency that not all possessed. As a result, the tool was deemed less efficient for this project, especially within the constraints of time and team expertise.</p>

            <section id="production" class="main">
                <header class="major"><h2>4. Production Phase</h2></header>
                <p>During the production phase, the team aimed to 3D print the artefact to assess the viability of the Blender file for printing. The team was divided, with some members focusing on final implementation within Blender, specifically the helmet and eye mechanism, while others concentrated on booking the printer using university facilities. This process involved checking the .STL files in the printing laboratory to ensure they were suitable for printing. Following this, a quote was provided by the laboratory, which then required approval from the project budget and module leader. Once approval was received, the booking could be finalised, and the print collected by a team member.</p>
                <p>The team successfully completed a final design of the helmet artefact (see Figure 1: Interactive 3D STL Model of Lion Helmet) with one week of project time remaining. 3D printing was booked and approved in the final week, with the eye mechanism weighing 191 grams of PLA at a cost of £11, and the helmet artefact weighing 274 grams of PLA at a cost of £17. The total cost of printing was £28 for the first run, which was well within the £200 team budget, with no other expenditure at that stage of the project.</p>
                <p>While submitting the helmet part of the artefact for printing, an issue arose that delayed production. The 3D printing specialist identified that the helmet’s .STL file had missing thickness in areas around the eyes, preventing the software from properly filling the gaps. This required the design-focused team members to review and revise the file, adding sufficient thickness to enable successful printing. Once updated, the model was approved for production. This issue highlights how small, unexpected challenges can arise at any stage of the product design and development process. Fortunately, with assignment specialists on the team, the issue was swiftly and efficiently resolved, allowing the production to move forward.</p>

                <p>Once approved, the printing of the eye mechanism was attempted. The process began smoothly, with most parts being printed to an acceptable standard. However, the first print of the base of the eye mechanism failed, encountering issues when layering the connective parts. This highlights some of the challenges that can arise when printing finer or more detailed components using 3D printing. A positive aspect of the technology was the quick solution it offered, a second print was initiated immediately after the first, and a successful base was completed later that same day, allowing the team to proceed with assembling the moving eye mechanism.<p>

                <h3>4.1 Technologies</h3>
                <h4>4.1.1 3D Printing</h4>
                <p>3D printing, or additive manufacturing, has become a key component in product development due to its efficiency and ease of use in producing 3D models. These systems integrate well with 3D development environments, as used in this project, and allow for straightforward realisation of digital designs. While 3D printing can be employed for larger or more durable items using materials such as metals, its primary application remains in the creation of smaller, plastic-based components like those in this artefact.</p>
                <p>3D printing technology enables rapid prototyping, which supports the iterative nature of product development. This approach allows for faster optimisation of products through multiple iterations, where improvements and redesigns can be carried out much more quickly (Salmi, 2022). Additionally, 3D printing processes can operate almost autonomously and even outside typical working hours, significantly boosting production efficiency and potentially reducing overall manufacturing costs.</p>
                <p>However, challenges do exist with more modern, advanced 3D printing technologies. High-precision, industrial-grade equipment often comes with substantial initial investment costs, limiting access and wider deployment. This, in turn, reduces the broader impact of the technology in manufacturing. Furthermore, increased automation may threaten traditional roles within the manufacturing sector, potentially leading to significant job displacement.</p>
                <h4>4.1.2 Silicone Production</h4>
                <p>Silicone is a flexible and durable material often used in prototyping, especially where soft, detailed components are needed. It can replicate fine surface textures, making it ideal for elements like skin or eyes. Some robotic systems use silicone overlays on sensors to enable haptic and temperature sensing, due to its elasticity and surface responsiveness (Yu et al., 2024). The material’s elasticity and soft-touch feel allow for sensory interaction to occur directly on the surface, providing a more life-like and responsive element within robotic systems. Its realistic qualities make it ideal for use in wearable or expressive components, which is why it was considered as a potential option for this artefact in the early stages of design.</p>
                <p>In this project, silicone was not used. The eye area, being central to the mechanical design, would likely require multiple iterations, and the high cost of silicone for such detailed work could have pushed the team over budget. Additionally, moulding and curing silicone takes time, which did not align with the project's schedule and resource constraints.</p>
                <p>This decision reflects a common challenge in product development: balancing ideal materials with practical limitations. Although silicone would offer aesthetic and functional benefits, its use was not feasible at this stage. If further development were pursued, it could be reconsidered for more advanced or wearable versions of the artefact but would have to reflect the product price upon release.</p>

            <section id="testing" class="main">
                <header class="major"><h2>5. Future Work</h2></header>
                <p>While the team successfully 3D printed the eye mechanism of the artefact, the helmet component required more time than was available and ultimately could not be printed before the submission deadline. For future work, the team would need to iterate and refine both the helmet and eye mechanism to ensure correct sizing and alignment, allowing the eye mechanism to be properly installed within the helmet with adequate connection and fit.</p>
                <p>Following this, the team could focus on final improvements and aesthetic enhancements, such as painting the artefact and adding design elements like whiskers and surface texture to achieve the intended young lion aesthetic. These tasks could be completed in a relatively short time, especially when compared to earlier phases of the project, where delays in modelling and printing logistics contributed to the artefact remaining incomplete by the deadline.</p>
                <h3>5.1 Technologies</h3>
                <h4>5.1.1 Laser Cutting</h4>
                <p>Laser cutting is a fast and accurate fabrication method commonly used in prototyping to produce clean 2D cuts or engravings on materials like acrylic, MDF, or cardboard. It is particularly useful for creating structural frameworks, stencils, or layered components. For this project, laser cutting was considered in the early stages as a method to produce internal structure supports or flat template parts for alignment within the helmet.</p>
                <p>However, due to the helmet’s complex curved geometry, laser cutting was not suitable for the main components. While efficient for flat shapes, its limitation to two-dimensional forms made it impractical for the organic design of the lion-inspired helmet. Critically, the choice to exclude laser cutting reflects an appropriate design decision, one that prioritised fit-for-purpose technologies over convenience. In future versions of the artefact, laser cutting could still be useful for accessories or display elements, but it would not add value to the core 3D form of the helmet.</p>
                <h4>5.1.2 Motion Capture and Face Capture</h4>
                <p>Motion capture was explored in the module as a way of recording physical movement and translating it into digital data. This has valuable applications in robotics and animation, especially when designing artefacts that respond to human motion. In this project, motion capture was considered as a tool for understanding natural movement, particularly in relation to eye motion and facial gestures that could influence the design of the eyelid mechanism.</p>
                <p>Although not implemented, critically analysing its relevance highlights that motion capture may have introduced unnecessary complexity at this early prototyping stage. The main focus was on mechanical movement rather than responsive interaction, so applying motion capture would have shifted the project towards performative outcomes rather than product design. Nonetheless, in future work, especially if expression and interactivity become priorities, facial motion capture could provide valuable data to enhance realism and user engagement in the artefact.</p>

                <header class="major"><h2>6. Conclusion</h2></header>
                <p>This project has demonstrated the end-to-end development of a conceptual robotic artefact, combining creative ambition with practical design strategies. From early sketching and digital modelling in Blender to prototyping using 3D printing technologies, each phase contributed to the formation of a lion-inspired wearable helmet featuring an animated eye mechanism. Although the helmet itself was not printed due to time constraints, the successful fabrication of the eye mechanism marked a key technical achievement.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project, critical decisions were made regarding material use, tool selection, and workflow, balancing creative goals with constraints such as budget, time, and available expertise. Technologies like silicone production and motion capture were explored, with thoughtful consideration of their future potential despite not being directly implemented. The project ultimately reflects a strong understanding of how virtual and physical prototyping methods can be applied and evaluated within a structured product development process.</p>
